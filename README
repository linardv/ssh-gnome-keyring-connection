                         ------------------------------

ssh-gnome-keyring-connection allows the user to automatically add keys to the
ssh-agent upon logging in without to type in the passphrases. The passphrases
are stored and retrieved from the GNOME Keyring.

                                     Usage
                                    -------

Usage:
    ssh-gnome-keyring-conncetion <mode> <name>

Parameters:
    mode  - either 'get' or 'set' (without quotes)
    name  - a name to identify the key

Notes:
    If mode is 'get', then the password is dumped to stdout.
    If mode is 'set', then the password is read from stdin.
