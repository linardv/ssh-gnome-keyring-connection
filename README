                          ssh-gnome-keyring-connection
                         ------------------------------

ssh-gnome-keyring-connection (in short, ssh-kc) allows the user to
automatically add keys to the ssh-agent upon logging in without to type in the
passphrases. The passphrases are stored and retrieved from the GNOME Keyring.

                                     Usage
                                    -------

Usage:
    ssh-kc <mode> <name>
Parameters:
    mode     - 'set' (without quotes)
    name     - a name to identify the key

For more information see:
    ssh-kc -h

Add your passphrase to the GNOME Keyring by feeding it on stdin to ssh-kc.
There are several way to do this, one of them is:
echo -n "mypassphrase" | ssh-kc set default-key

Add the '${HOME}/.ssh-kc/ssh-kc-autorun.sh' script to the applications your
session manager (e.g: gnome-session, xfce4-session, ...) would start when you
log in. Your ssh-key will be loaded the next time you log in.

For more information on how to add multiple keys or keys that are not placed on
the default location see the scripts in:
'${HOME}/.ssh-kc'
